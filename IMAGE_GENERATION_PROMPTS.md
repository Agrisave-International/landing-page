## Tips for Best Results

### General Guidelines:
1. **Use "photorealistic" or "professional photography"** for hero and testimonial images
2. **Specify "4K quality" or "high detail"** for better resolution
3. **Include "natural lighting"** for outdoor farm scenes
4. **Add "clean modern design"** for UI/dashboard screenshots
5. **Specify color palette:** "green and brown agricultural colors"

### For Midjourney:
- Add `--ar 16:9` for landscape images
- Add `--ar 1:1` for square images
- Add `--v 6` for latest version
- Add `--style raw` for more photorealistic results

### For DALL-E 3:
- Be specific about composition and lighting
- Mention "professional" and "high quality"
- Avoid copyrighted terms

### For Stable Diffusion:
- Use detailed prompts with specific camera angles
- Add negative prompts: "blurry, low quality, distorted"
- Use models trained on photography for realistic images

## Priority Order

If you're creating images gradually, do them in this order:

1. ✅ **Logo** (already done - agrisave-logo.png)
2. **Hero image** (satellite-farm-monitoring.webp) - Most important!
3. **OG image** (og-image.jpg) - For social sharing
4. **Favicons** (favicon-32x32.png, etc.) - For browser tabs
5. **Feature images** (optional but nice to have)
6. **Testimonial photos** (optional, can use placeholder avatars)
